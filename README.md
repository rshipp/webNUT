servers, built on Pyramid, Bootstrap, and
[python-nut2][2].

## Setup

Rename `webnut/config.example.py` to `webnut/config.py` and set the
variables in that file to reflect your NUT server configuration. Then
serve webNUT as you would any Pyramid app, using `pserve` or through
your production-ready server of choice.

## Screenshots

The index lists available UPS devices on each server, along with their description,
status, and battery charge:

![Index](screenshots/ups_index.png "Index")

Clicking on a UPS's name takes you to a details view that shows a quick
status indicator, as well as the values of all variables set on the
device:

Clicking on the power icon will return to the index page.
